          “Of course I know Lyney and Lynette. I used to frequently attend their magic shows. Though they're very popular, they're still much less popular than me. Only my performances would draw a completely sold-out crowd... even standing tickets would be out. But now... Uh... 
          I've already decided to hang up my acting career, so it's perfectly normal for my popularity to decline!”
