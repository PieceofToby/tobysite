    Rouses the impulse to revel, creating a stage of foam that will deal AoE Hydro DMG based on Furina's Max HP and cause nearby party members to enter the Universal Revelry state: 
    During this time, when nearby party members' HP increases or decreases, 1 Fanfare point will be granted to Furina for  each percentage point of their Max HP by which their HP changes. At the  same time, Furina will increase the DMG dealt by and Incoming Healing  Bonus of all nearby party members based on the amount of Fanfare she has. 
    When the duration ends, Furina's Fanfare points will be cleared.
