        The Traveler and Paimon arrive in Fontaine. 
        Locals inform the duo about the Court of Fontaine, and about Neuvilette and the Oratrice Mechanique d’Anelyse Cardinale that make sure true justice is served at the end of every trial, no matter how dramaticized.

        Navia decides that there is one place to look in that they could never reach - the archives stored by Neuvillette, which would be their best bet to find more information.

  Neuvillette informs the two that Childe had also disappeared from the prison, though he is not sure as to where he went since there were no reports of him being seen outside the prison either.

<p class="body-text">
  To enter the prison, he offers to press false charges on the Traveler and Paimon, which they accept. After doing some work, they meet up with Lyney and Lynette, who threw themselves in prison with a small "theft" performance to do so. 
  Lyney, not wanting to hide any more secrets following his previous experience with them, reveals that the prison hides a secret and that "Father" was able to confirm that Furina did not have the Hydro Gnosis.

  With a brief moment of respite, Wriothesley informs the Traveler to  fetch Neuvillette, knowing that they would not be able to hold back the water for long. Back at the party, Arlecchino drops the pleasantries and confronts Furina over the prophecy, accusing her of not protecting her people. 
  Furina claims to have a primary and backup plan, though when Arlecchino questions her over it, claims both to be confidential.
